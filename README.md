# Run-Wild

Run wild! 🐾 A gamified running app that turns your workouts into art — run in the shape of animals, unlock new routes, and challenge friends. Uses path optimization to generate animal-shaped runs based on your location and distance goal.

Todo List:
- Read user current location from iPhone (Probably represented by Latitude and longitude)
- Plan the running path (Given the starting point and distance, use an AI API to help plan the path into certain shape given the map representation (perhaps as a graph))
